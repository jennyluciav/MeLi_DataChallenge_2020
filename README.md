# MeLi DataChallenge 2020

## My solution to the 2020 MeLi DataChallenge

Instructions to run this code:

1. Place in the "./data/input" folder the following files:<sup>1</sup>
	- item_data.jl
	- test_dataset.jl
	- train_dataset.jl

2. Then simply run the "main.py" script.<sup>2, 3</sup>


Notes:

<sup>1</sup> The data can be donwloaded from: https://ml-challenge.mercadolibre.com/downloads

<sup>2</sup> This script requires 32 GB of RAM to run.

<sup>3</sup> Final predictions may differ a bit from the ones submitted due to the randomness of the word2vec training algorithm.
